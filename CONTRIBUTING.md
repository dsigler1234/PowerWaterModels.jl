## Code Contributions
Community-driven development and enhancement of PowerWaterModels is welcomed and encouraged.
Please feel free to fork this repository and share your contributions to the master branch with a pull request.
That said, it is important to keep in mind the code quality requirements and scope of PowerWaterModels before preparing a contribution.

### PowerWaterModels Scope
The primary motivation for PowerWaterModels is to help researchers quickly and easily replicate _established_ results in joint power-water distribution system optimization.
More preliminary research and development efforts are best left to other packages that extend PowerWaterModels.
That said, the PowerWaterModels package should have a software design that makes building such extensions as easy as possible.

### Code Quality Requirements
PowerWaterModels strives to be a user-friendly, highly-reliable, and well-maintained package.
To that end, the following code quality controls are necessary for all contributions:
- All features must have unit tests.
- Naming conventions must be consistent.
- Core features must have documentation.
- Code style must be consistent (e.g., four spaces for indentation).

Due to these quality control requirements, pull requests to PowerWaterModels may require lengthy discussion and code review.
